Uncovering the key drivers behind customer drop-offs in e-commerce is crucial to unlocking business growth. Using <strong><em>Explainable AI</em></strong>, our goal was to identify these drivers and pinpoint actionable strategies that will retain and convert customers. This project represents a milestone in our Machine Learning 2 course within the MS in Data Science program at AIM.

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
In today's marketing landscape, the power of influencer marketing is undeniable. Yet, the meticulous process of choosing the right partners poses challenges both in terms of time and expense. To address this, we harnessed the potential of machine learning and information retrieval techniques. Using a brand's existing social network and aggregating data from influential personalities, we streamlined the partner selection process. The outcome: a curated list of potential celebrity and influencer partners, including micro and macro influencers, resulting in efficiency gains and potential cost savings. This initiative marked a milestone in our Data Mining and Wrangling 2 course within the MS in Data Science program at AIM.

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
In a highly connected nation, a temporary Internet shutdown carries an average daily economic impact of $23.6 million per 10 million inhabitants. Beyond the economic consequences, it leads to reduced productivity, communication challenges, and a surge in customer complaints. Our focus is on the latter. We aim to identify complaint characteristics that enable internet providers to swiftly allocate concerns to the right department, expediting resolutions and enhancing customer experience. This initiative marks a significant milestone in our Data Mining and Wranling 1 course within the MS in Data Science program at AIM.

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
  In manufacturing, maintaining top-tier quality standards is essential. However, guaranteeing this quality is challenging due to the rarity, scale, sensitivity, and complexity of defects. By combining advanced data mining, deep learning techniques, and explainable AI, we address these challenges to help quality management for manufacturing companies. This project marks a pivotal achievement in our Machine Learning 3 course within the MS in Data Science program at AIM.

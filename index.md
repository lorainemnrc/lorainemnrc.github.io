Uncovering the key drivers behind customer drop-offs in e-commerce is crucial to unlocking business growth. Using Explainable AI, our goal was to identify these drivers and pinpoint actionable strategies that will retain and convert customers. This project represents a milestone in our Machine Learning 2 coursework within the MS in Data Science program at AIM.

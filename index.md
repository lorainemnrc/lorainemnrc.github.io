  In a highly connected nation, a <strong><em>temporary Internet shutdown</em></strong> leads to reduced productivity, communication challenges, and a <strong><em>surge in customer complaints</em></strong>. With topic modeling techniques, we <strong><em>identify and categorize complaint characteristics</em></strong> that enable internet providers to swiftly allocate concerns to the right department, expediting resolutions and enhancing customer experience.

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
  In manufacturing, maintaining <strong><em>top-tier quality standards</em></strong> is essential. However, guaranteeing this quality is challenging due to the rarity, scale, sensitivity, and complexity of defects. By combining <strong><em>advanced data mining, deep learning techniques, and explainable AI,</em></strong> we address these challenges to help quality management for manufacturing companies.

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
  With about 90% of journal articles remaining uncited, and around 50% unnoticed by authors and editors, <strong><em>maximizing the impact of scholarly work</em></strong> is important. Using big data analysis and machine learning, we <strong><em>identify factors that influence article citations and readership</em></strong> to guide researchers and institutions on which articles to focus based on their potential for impact.

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
  In the Philippines, manual counting and verification of bills has been the long customary practice. Despite the recent developments in the field of fintech, <strong><em>94% of Filipinos still prefer cash-in transactions</em></strong>. However, there are several challenges encountered in manual counting as follows but not limited to human error, fraud, time-consuming, inefficiency, and risk of fraud. To address this, we developed an application that uses <strong><em>computer vision to detect and count Philippine currency bills</em></strong> to streamline simple financial management tasks, reducing human error and ensuring secure and efficient operations.
